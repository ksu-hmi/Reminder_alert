Background:                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Breathing, an integral lifesaving part of our lives. Need a reminder to focus on, occasionally. 
Calm yourself, breathe slowly, take a deep breath before your big moment and it helps. 
Everyone needs that Reminder once in while ðŸ˜Š                                                                                                                                                                                      
As a founder of a wellness company, catering to the corporate sector focusing on helping companies improve employee health and well-being, leading to increased productivity and a healthier workforce.
As a corporate wellness consultant, I help companies improve employee well-being by designing, implementing, and managing wellness programs by assessing employee needs, developing strategies to promote healthy behaviors, and evaluating the effectiveness of wellness initiatives. 
In the project, key considerations are:
1. Understanding Corporate Needs:
â€¢	Conduct thorough research:
Research showed that with the cumbersome lifestyle, employee productivity goes down thruâ€™ the end of the workday and closer to the start of the weekend.
â€¢	Tailor programs:
I developed a customized wellness initiative that addresses specific health concerns and align with the company's culture.
â€¢	Focus on employee engagement:
To make wellness programs accessible and appealing to encourage participation, we launched a Wellness program.                                                                                                          
Key features of the program include â€“ 
1.	Easy to use in a group setting or as an individual â€“ Group setting is effective way to approach the issue collectively.
2.	No need to buy extra tools or accessories.
3.	Accessible anywhere and anytime.
How the program works â€“ 
Company wanted an easy-to-adapt solution for employeesâ€™ well-being. The program was kicked off using a reminder theory to take a break, close the eyes and focus on breathing. It started with 1 minute exercise, with soothing music in the background (initial stages) 
A reminder light was installed in the meeting room that gently pulses a LED button at specified times until the button is pushed to turn it off using Raspberry Pi. An effortless way to remind to focus on the breathing.
â€¢	Track progress and measure results:
On a trial basis, it was established at one meeting room at the corporate office. After successful testing and receiving great employee feedback, the program was conducted at various company locations.
